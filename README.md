❤️ Falling For You – Valentine's Catch Game
A charming, interactive web game designed as a creative way to ask someone to be your Valentine. Players must catch falling hearts to fill their "Love Meter" and unlock the final proposal.

Catch Hearts: Move your mouse (or touch and drag on mobile) to control the basket and catch falling hearts.

The Big Question: Once the meter is full, the game pauses to reveal the proposal modal.

The "No" Button: Try to click "No" if you can—it runs away!
